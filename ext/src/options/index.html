<body>
    <p>
        List users you want to hide here (one per line). List either their
        full name or their username (the piece after
        <code>https://www.facebook.com/</code> in their profile's URL). If
        they don't have a username, you can list their ID (the number after
        <code>?profile.php=</code> in their profile's URL).
    </p>
    <textarea rows="15" cols="60"></textarea>
    <p>
        After changing this, the new setting will be applied to any
        new/reloaded Facebook tabs.
